Improvements:

    - Add python script_utils functions to save and read arbitrary test data.
      The data is written to a file in the test execution directory.  For
      example, consider a test named "mytest",

          import script_utils as util
          util.save_test_data( runtime=34.7, result='pass' )

      The data can be read in as a dictionary from the current or a dependency
      test.  For example, if the following test depends on "mytest",

          import script_utils as util
          data = util.read_test_data( "mytest" )
          print ( 'mytest runtime is', data['runtime'] )

    - Add function to python script_utils to recursively find dependency tests.
      Use script_utils.deputils.find_depdir( testid ) to get the directory of
      a direct or indirect dependency test.

    - In script tests, the "testname" directive can be used instead of "test".
      For example, this specifies the test name to be "mytest",

          #VVT: testname = mytest

Fixes:

    - Duplicate paths in DEPDIRS in vvtest_util.py file, issue #13.

    - Using the post clean option, -C, would incorrectly clean dependency
      tests coming from a general "depends on" specification.

Changes:

    - In python script tests, "import script_util" will no longer import all
      the symbols from the vvtest_util.py file.  That is, instead of this in
      your test file,

          import script_util as util
          util.print3( 'NAME =', util.NAME )

      you now have to import vvtest_util.py separately,

          import vvtest_util as vvt
          import script_util as util
          util.print3( 'NAME =', vvt.NAME )

      or, of course, just dump all the symbols into the current namespace,

          from vvtest_util import *
          from script_util import *
          print3( 'NAME =', NAME )

    - The (argument) and (file) attributes to the "baseline" directive are no
      longer supported, such as

          #VVT: baseline (argument) : my-option
          #VVT: baseline (file) : filename

      Now an option can only start with a hyphen, such as

          #VVT: baseline : --my-option

      and a baseline script filename cannot contain a comma (because a comma
      is used to decide if you are specifying pairs of files).

    - The (argument) and (file) attributes to the "analyze" directive are no
      longer supported, such as

          #VVT: analyze (file) : analyze_script
          #VVT: analyze (argument) : analyze-option

      Now an option can only start with a hyphen, such as

          #VVT: analyze : --analyze-option

      otherwise a script file name is assumed.

    - Language selection of script tests has been simplified.  The new logic
      is that if the test file is executable, it is run directly.  If it is
      not executable, the python interpreter is run on the file.  This applies
      to the "analyze" and "baseline" directive keywords.

      A related aspect of this is that only (and always both) python and bash
      script util fragments are written to the test run directory.  Before
      this change, other languages were supported, such as csh.

    - The test list format used for running tests has changed.  It is now at
      version 32 and previous versions cannot be read.  This just means that
      a current test results area will have to be wiped and the tests run
      again.

    - trig: Remove unnecessary options -S -C and -a.  Use the runner script
      to launch now.

    - The command.py utility changed a default.  The Command.run functions
      now default raise_on_error to True.

    - Python 2.5 is no longer supported.

    - Using the deprecated option -F now exits with a failure.  It has been
      replaced by the -R option.

    - The -H option has been removed.  It is the same as --help and -h.

    - Option -v to get the version is deprecated.  Use --version instead.

    - Option --pipeline is deprecated.  Use --batch instead.

    - The --qsub-limit option is being deprecated in favor of --batch-limit
      (with the same meaning).  Similarly, --qsub-length is being deprecated
      in favor of --batch-length.

    - The --check=<name> option is deprecated.  Using --check=FOO just causes
      the environment variable CHECK_FOO to get defined.  The XML test format
      can check for environment variables using the 'ifdef' attribute.  So
      defining CHECK_FOO before running vvtest accomplishes the same thing.
      Also, the more general --test-args option is a better solution.

    - The --vg option has been removed.  It was used to run Valgrind on each
      test.  The same thing can be accomplished using --test-args.

    - The -G option has been removed.  It is historical.

    - The --junit test results output format has been enhanced a little.  It
      will now include the execute.log contents for tests that fail or diff.
      However, the middle of the file will be cut out if it is too big.


==============================================================================

Release 1.0
-----------

Aug 26, 2018

Improvements:

    - Add "insert directive file" keyword to test file preprocessing.  This
      allows test header specifications to include and share specifications
      from other files.

    - Port to python 3.  All python versions greater or equal to 2.5 should
      work.

    - Add --run-dir <directory> option.  This overrides the default naming
      scheme of the "TestResults.<platform>.ON=.OFF=" pattern.

    - Add additional test script utilties, such as simple_aprepro.

    - Add --test-args <arguments> option.  This passes arbitrary arguments
      into each test script at runtime.

    - Add arbitrary test dependencies.  A test can now depend on another test.
      The test will not run until the dependency is run, and the directory of
      the dependency test is made available so its output can be processed.
      The test directive keyword is "depends on".

Fixes:

    - Allow recursive vvtest invocations.  Tests being run in vvtest can now
      invoke vvtest.

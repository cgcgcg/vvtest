Improvements:

Fixes:

    - Duplicate paths in DEPDIRS in vvtest_util.py file, issue #13.

    - Using the post clean option, -C, would incorrectly clean dependency
      tests coming from a general "depends on" specification.

Changes:

    - The (argument) and (file) attributes to the "baseline" directive are no
      longer supported, such as

          #VVT: baseline (argument) : my-option
          #VVT: baseline (file) : filename

      Now an option can only start with a hyphen, such as

          #VVT: baseline : --my-option

      and a baseline script filename cannot contain a comma (because a comma
      is used to decide if you are specifying pairs of files).

    - The (argument) and (file) attributes to the "analyze" directive are no
      longer supported, such as

          #VVT: analyze (file) : analyze_script
          #VVT: analyze (argument) : analyze-option

      Now an option can only start with a hyphen, such as

          #VVT: analyze : --analyze-option

      otherwise a script file name is assumed.

    - Language selection of script tests has been simplified.  The new logic
      is that if the test file is executable, it is run directly.  If it is
      not executable, the python interpreter is run on the file.  This applies
      to the "analyze" and "baseline" directive keywords.

      A related aspect of this is that only (and always both) python and bash
      script util fragments are written to the test run directory.  Before
      this, other languages were supported, such as csh.

    - The test list format used for running tests has changed.  It is now at
      version 32 and previous versions cannot be read.  This just means that
      a current test results area will have to be wiped and the tests run
      again.

    - trig: Remove unnecessary options -S -C and -a.  Use the runner script
      to launch now.

    - The command.py utility changed a default.  The Command.run functions
      now default raise_on_error to True.


==============================================================================

Release 1.0
-----------

Aug 26, 2018

Improvements:

    - Add "insert directive file" keyword to test file preprocessing.  This
      allows test header specifications to include and share specifications
      from other files.

    - Port to python 3.  All python versions greater or equal to 2.5 should
      work.

    - Add --run-dir <directory> option.  This overrides the default naming
      scheme of the "TestResults.<platform>.ON=.OFF=" pattern.

    - Add additional test script utilties, such as simple_aprepro.

    - Add --test-args <arguments> option.  This passes arbitrary arguments
      into each test script at runtime.

    - Add arbitrary test dependencies.  A test can now depend on another test.
      The test will not run until the dependency is run, and the directory of
      the dependency test is made available so its output can be processed.
      The test directive keyword is "depends on".

Fixes:

    - Allow recursive vvtest invocations.  Tests being run in vvtest can now
      invoke vvtest.

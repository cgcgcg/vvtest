# vvtest

**vvtest** is a test harness specialized for running regression, validation,
and verification tests on high performance computing (HPC) platforms.

At a high level, **vvtest** just selects and runs scripts, called tests.
It is the test specification and management capabilities together with the
plugin and control features that enable the execution of complex tests on
workstations up to large HPC platforms.

Notable features include:
* Pure Python, compatible with versions 2.6+ and 3.x
* Built-in CPU & GPU resource management and load balancing
* Built-in support for HPC batch queuing systems, such as SLURM and LSF
* Test parameterization, allowing a single script file to produce multiple
  test instances with different parameter values
* Inter-test dependencies - tests can depend on other tests. Dependencies
  are run first and the results are available in the dependent test.
* Test selection and execution control, such as by keyword, parameter,
  platform, and a general option string
* Tests can be any script language, but there is built-in support for Python
  and (to a lesser extent) Bash
* Configuration and plugins allow control over testing behavior
* Tests are executed in a separate directory from the test scripts
  ("out of source" execution)
* Test result output formats include CDash, GitLab markdown, JUnit, and HTML.


## Documentation

* Run `vvtest -h` to show the options.
* Run `vvtest help <subhelp>` to get help by topic area, such as "resources"
  and "filters".
* The RELEASE_NOTES file is kept up to date.
* Additional documentation available on the wiki.


## Additional Utilities

* The vvtools V&V testing utilities. This is a collection of Exodus-based
  utilities for running verification analyses on simulation output. It has
  its origins in ALEGRA but is much more generally applicable. The main tools
  here are `exodus.py`, not to be confused with the  seacas file of the same
  name, and `vcomp`, a convergence analysis tool.


## Download and Install

Since the only dependency is a *NIX OS with basic Python, just clone the
**vvtest** repository and run the `vvtest` script. You can optionally run the
`install_vvtest` script to install into a prefix of your choice.


## An Example

Consider a file called `mytest.vvt` with contents
```
# This is my cool test.
#VVT: parameterize: np = 1 2

import vvtest_util as vvt
import shared_stuff as stuff

print ( 'Starting test {0} np={1}'.format( vvt.NAME, vvt.np ) )

stuff.run_simulation( myoption='foo', numcpu=vvt.np )
stuff.check_results()
```
This test could be run as follows:
```
$ ls -R
.:
configdir  mytest.vvt

./configdir:
shared_stuff.py

$ vvtest --config=configdir

$ ls -F TestResults.ceelan/mytest.np=2
execute.log  mytest.vvt@  vvtest_util.py  vvtest_util.pyc  vvtest_util.sh
```
Note that the test specification file, `mytest.vvt`, resulted in two test
instances, `mytest.np=1` and `mytest.np=2`, which ran and passed.
In the test script, the `vvtest_util` Python module is specific to each
test and contains information about the test instance and runtime parameters.
The `shared_stuff` is a (hypothetical) Python module that the software
project itself supplies in a configuration directory.
Finally, whether the test passes or fails, the `execute.log` file contains
the output (stdout and stderr).


## Testing


## History

**vvtest** evolved from Mike Wong's test infrastructure in the late 1990s,
through a python rewrite in the mid 2000s, to a refactoring in 2016 to
make it a project independent utility.
